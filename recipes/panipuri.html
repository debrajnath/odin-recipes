    <h2>Instructions ü´ï</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the semolina, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Add enough water to make a stiff dough. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it becomes smooth.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, knead the dough again for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into small balls and roll them out into small circles. Cut the circles using a cookie cutter or a lid to make uniform shapes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the circles and fry them until they puff up and turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried circles from the oil and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>Mix the mashed potatoes, boiled chickpeas, chopped onions, chopped coriander leaves, roasted cumin powder, red chili powder, chaat masala, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a small hole on top of each fried circle and fill it with the potato and chickpea mixture.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, mix chilled water, mint leaves, and a little salt to make the spicy and tangy water.</li>
