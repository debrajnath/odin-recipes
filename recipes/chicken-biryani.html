    <h2>Instructions üç≤</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, and salt. Add the chicken and mix well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and its marinade to the pot and cook until the chicken is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the pot and stir to coat with the remaining oil and spices. Add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the rice is almost cooked.</li>
        <li>Arrange the chicken on top of the rice in a single layer. Sprinkle the reserved onions over the chicken. Cover the pot and continue to cook over low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the chicken is tender, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 5-10 minutes before uncovering. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with chopped cilantro before serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!</li>
